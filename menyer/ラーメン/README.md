Renamed the class "distance" to "spacing_btw_elements. Think it is the best name for that class as it is used as a space between all horizontal elements throughout the webpage. How would you name this class?

I have tried to work with box_1, box_2 ... but find it difficult to do this in a good way. my solution was to reorganize among my box classes. I think it's more manageable as it looks now. Understands your idea with a main class "box" but thinks that there are too few similarities for it to give a better result. Am I thinking wrong? Please, feel free to come up with a suggestion.
